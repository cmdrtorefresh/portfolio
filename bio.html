        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I have always enjoyed the thrill of finding solutions. In my previous career, I designed seawater desalination systems for projects in fresh-water scarce places around the world. When I wasn't involved in desalination projects, I helped companies reused the water content in their waste water. Every project had its own problems and rewards.</p>
        <p>Later on, I was introduced to my first computing language, Python. When I built my first project from scratch, the game Battleship, I knew my affair with software development has started. I self-taught myself more languages and built more personal projects, fueled by a definite "I can learn this" and a combination of "It'd be fun to..." and "There's gotta be a better way to do this!". I understand software engineering provides bridges to build more, and I answered that calling. After a lot of considerations, I left my company to rise to a new challenge.</p>
        <p>I realize that I like being closer to the user, "Front End" side. I guess the experience of listening to customers' needs makes me pay attention to how a user interract with something I built. Naturally, I got attracted to web and mobile development due to the amount of direct contact with users they include.</p>
        <p>I am happy with what I have learned so far. No doubt that there's an ocean of fast-changing knowledge in front of me and I'm excited of my potential. I know I can create more, bigger, and more useful things with experience. I trully believe everybody can learn when they want.</p>
