        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>My first computing language was Python. When I built my first project from scratch, the game Battleship, my affair with software development started. Since then, I self-taught myself a few more languages and built more personal projects, fueled by a definite "I can totally do this" and a combination of "It'd be fun to..." and "There's gotta be a better way to do this!". I realize software engineering grants great power to willing individuals, providing bridges to awesome things. After a lot of considerations, I left my previous company to rise to a new challenge.</p>
        <p>I have always enjoyed the thrill of finding solutions. Having graduated from University of Wisconsin with Bachelor or Science degree in Chemical Engineering, I designed seawater desalination systems for projects in fresh-water scarce places around the world in my previous career. I was puzzles solving, an industrial-scale one. When I wasn't involved in desalination projects, I helped companies reuse the water content in their waste water.</p>
        <p>I like being closer to the user. I guess the experience of listening to customers' needs makes me pay attention to how a user interract with something I built. Naturally, I got attracted to web and mobile development due to the amount of direct contact with users they include.</p>
        <p>I am happy with what I have learned so far. No doubt that there's an ocean of fast-changing knowledge in front of me and I'm excited of my potential. I know I can create more, bigger, and more useful things with experience. I believe everybody can when they want and act upon their curiosity of "how to".</p>
        <p>When I'm not in front of my computer, I keep myself active by practicing yoga and dancing tango.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, "Face Everything and Rise". </p>
